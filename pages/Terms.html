                    Remedy
                </h5>
                <p>
                    It is understood and agreed by the Customer that RedCode EHS LLC ("Company") is not an insurer and
                    that insurance coverage, if any, shall be obtained by the Customer. The amounts payable to the
                    Company under this agreement are based upon the value of the services and the scope of liability set
                    forth herein and are not related to the value of the Customer’s property or the property of others
                    located on the premises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customer agrees to look exclusively to their own insurer to recover for injuries or damages in the
                    event of any loss or injury and expressly releases and waives all rights of recovery against the
                    Company arising by way of subrogation. The Company makes no guarantee or warranty, including any
                    implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, that any equipment or
                    services supplied will detect or avert any occurrence or the consequences thereof that the equipment
                    or service is designed to detect or avert.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is impractical and extremely difficult to determine the actual damages, if any, that may result
                    from the failure of the Company to perform any of its obligations under this agreement. Accordingly,
                    the Customer agrees that the Company shall be exempt from liability for any loss, damage, or injury
                    arising directly or indirectly from events that the equipment or service was intended to detect or
                    avert.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should the Company be found liable for any such loss, damage, or injury due to a failure of the
                    equipment or service in any respect, the Company's liability shall be limited to an amount equal to
                    the agreement price (as increased by any additional work charges), or in the case of time and
                    materials contracts, the amount paid by the Customer for such services. Where the agreement covers
                    multiple sites, liability is limited to the amount allocable to the site where the incident
                    occurred. This sum shall be the sole and exclusive remedy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Customer desires the Company to assume greater liability, the parties shall amend this
                    agreement with a signed rider specifying the additional liability and related cost. However, this
                    rider shall not be interpreted to imply that the Company is acting as an insurer.
                </p>

                </h5>
                <p>
                    The Customer represents that, to the best of their knowledge, and unless previously disclosed in
                    writing to the Company prior to execution of this agreement, the premises do not contain any of the
                    following hazardous conditions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A “permit confined space” as defined by OSHA, or any space where work presents risks due to
                        hazardous gas, dust, fumes, or infectious agents</li>
                    <li>A need for air monitoring, respiratory protection, or other health-related precautions</li>
                    <li>Asbestos, asbestos-containing materials, formaldehyde, or any other hazardous material on
                        floors, ceilings, insulation, or structural elements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are collectively referred to as “Hazardous Conditions.” The Company is entitled to rely on the
                    above representations. If Hazardous Conditions are discovered during service, such discovery shall
                    be deemed an event beyond the Company's control. Work shall cease in that area until the Customer
                    certifies it is safe, through documentation from an independent testing agency. The Customer shall
                    bear any disruption or re-mobilization costs resulting from such conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This agreement does not include the costs related to the identification, removal, containment, or
                    disposal of hazardous materials or waste. Such responsibilities remain with the Customer at all
                    times.

                <p>
                    RedCode EHS LLC shall not be held responsible for delays or failures in service due to events
                    outside its control, including but not limited to labor shortages, work stoppages, natural
                    disasters, civil unrest, or material shortages.

                    The Customer acknowledges that the Limitation of Liability and related provisions described herein
